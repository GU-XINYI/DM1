# Data Mining: fundamentals (2023-24)
DM1 Project: [Dataset](dataset)  |  [Codes](scripts)  |  [Final report](Report_Ye_Gu_Li.pdf)

Practical level of the Data Mining course, a project need to be created and presented that requires to analyze a spotify dataset with different mining methods using python. And a written report need to be prepared showing the results of the project activity and the interpretation of the results found.
