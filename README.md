"The Spotify Tracks dataset contains data concerning audio tracks accessible via the Spotify catalogue. These tracks span 20 distinct genres, such as techno, idm, study, and black-metal. Each track is equipped with fundamental attributes: track name, artist, album name, and its popularity within the catalogue. Additionally, audio-derived features are included, encompassing aspects like danceability, energy, key, and loudness."
